# auto_proto_registry_loader

## Context 

Automatically load up your Protobuf generated Golang types into the Protobuf registry (from the generated code), 
so that you can lookup by name of Protobuf message type.

Consider you have a Golang module containing the Golang types generated by Protobuf and you wish to look up
the type of the Protobuf message using the name of the message type i.e. like have a utility method to do look up in a 
schema registry.

This project automatically loads your types into protobuf registry by using the generated golang code instead
of the proto defintion files.

## Motivation

Enable your Golang module to now serve as a Schema Registry as well. 
i.e. make the 'protoregistry.GlobalTypes.FindMessageByName(name)' method work without reading proto files.
