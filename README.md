# auto_proto_registry_loader

## Context 

Automatically load up your Protobuf generated Golang types into the Protobuf registry (from the generated code), 
so that you can lookup by name of Protobuf message type.

Consider you have a Golang module containing the Golang types generated by Protobuf and you wish to look up
the type of the Protobuf message using the name of the message type i.e. like have a utility method to do look up in a 
schema registry.

This project helps you to automatically loads your types into protobuf registry by using the generated golang code instead
of the proto definition files.

## Motivation

Enable your Golang module to now serve as a Schema Registry as well. 
i.e. make the 'protoregistry.GlobalTypes.FindMessageByName(name)' method work without reading proto files.

## How to prepare your golang module ?

Say you have the golang module 'github.com/dc/batman' which you intend to also serve a golang registry:

```bash
project_dir(github.com/dc/batman)   
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- README.md
    |-- go.mod
    |-- go.sum
    |-- go_bindings
    |   |-- foo
    |   |   `-- bar.pb.go
    |-- proto
    |   `-- foo
    |       `-- bar
    |           `-- bar.proto
```

1. prepare the registry for loading the types
```
cd $project_dir
#go run -mod=mod github.com/jaihind213/auto_proto_registry_loader/load/ <full_path_to__go_bindings> <go_module_url> 
go run -mod=mod github.com/jaihind213/auto_proto_registry_loader/load/ $go_workspace_dir/src/github.com/dc/batman/go_bindings github.com/dc/batman
#run go mod tidy, to undo the change go run does to your go.mod file
go mod tidy
```

After running the auto_proto_registry_loader, you will notice a new file has been generated (pocket_registry/register_proto_defs.go)

```bash
project_dir(github.com/dc/batman)    
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- README.md
    |-- go.mod
    |-- go.sum
    |-- go_bindings
    |   |-- foo
    |   |   `-- bar.pb.go
    |   `-- pocket_registry
    |       `-- register_proto_defs.go
    |-- proto
    |   `-- foo
    |       `-- bar
    |           `-- bar.proto
```

2. Commit this file (pocket_registry/register_proto_defs.go) into the github.com/dc/batman repo !

3. Run your build and package the golang module.

4. In your golang source code which imports this golang module (i.e imports github.com/dc/batman), add an implicit import.
 ```
import (
	_ "github.com/dc/batman/go_bindings/pocket_registry"
	//Make sure you add this import in a package you know will definitely be used.(say where main() is defined)
	...
)
```

5. Now for the Schema Registry lookup, add the following Code for lookup of type by name as follows:
```
//this requires an import of "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoregistry"
msgType, err := protoregistry.GlobalTypes.FindMessageByName(protoreflect.FullName("foo.bar.Keeper"))
//now use golang reflection to create instance of that type.
msgInstance := msgType.New().Interface()
if e := protojson.Unmarshal(json, msgInstance.(proto.Message)); e != nil {
    fmt.Print(e.Error())
}
```

## Protecting the build

As you have seen, once we prepare the auto-generated file, we need to commit it into the repo.
Sometimes, a developer might forget to re-run the preparation step after he/she modifies the proto definitions.

You could automate the 2 steps (preparation + commit to repo) as part of your build process 

or

The 2 steps remain manual with a check in build process to see if developer has done the 2 steps.

Here is an example of how I did it gitlab-ci.yml

```
validate_imports:
  stage: check_imports_file
  image: golang:1.15
  script:
    - go run -mod=mod github.com/jaihind213/auto_proto_registry_loader/load/ <full_path_to__go_bindings> <go_module_url>
    - git status
    - exit_code=0
    - git status|grep register_proto_defs.go |grep modified || exit_code=$?
    - if [ ${exit_code} -eq 0 ];then echo "please run 'go run -mod=mod github.com/jaihind213/auto_proto_registry_loader/load/ <full_path_to__go_bindings> <go_module_url>' & commit the generated file 'register_proto_defs.go' for build to succeed"; exit 2; fi

```
